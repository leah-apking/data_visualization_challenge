# data_visualization_challenge

This challenge applied Matplotlib and Pandas plots to a data set from Pymacuticals. This dataset detailed an animal study to test the companies drug of interest, Capomulin,  compared to other treatment regimens in treating SCC, a common skin cance. The study included  249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth over 45 days each mouse recieved a drug regimen plus a placebo group.

Capomulin was shown to be one of the most effective drug regimens tested. Both Capomlin and Ramicane were shown to reduce tumor volumes in mice, while all other drug regimens tested were found to have very little effect.

Mice treated with Capomulin  had a mean tumor volume of 40.68mm3 and Ramicane mice had a mean tumor volume of 40.33mm3. Compared to the remaining seven drug regimens which had a combined average tumor volume of 53.55mm3 which was only slightly less than the placebo group average of 54.03mm3.

Taking a closer look at mouse j119 of the Capomulin group, we can see that her tumor trended downward in volume over time.

The success of the Capomulin and Ramicane regimen groups is also illustrated by the box plot, which shows that nearly all mice in these groups show lower final tumor volumes than the mice from the Infubinol and Ceftamin regimens.

Mouse weight was found to have a 0.84 cooraltion to average tumor volume, we larger mice experiencing larger tumor volumes.

As the drug of interest, Capomulin performed extremely well in this study and hopefully it will help propel the drug forward into the next stages of testing. However, Ramicane proformed equally as well as Capomulin and should also be considered for additional studies.
